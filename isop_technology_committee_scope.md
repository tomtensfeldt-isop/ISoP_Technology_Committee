-   Prepare website/wiki with software compendium

-   hub for PMx resources and tools

    -   how to use NONMEM from central africa for example

## Interchange hub for connecting users on using technology for MIDD


# Platform for exchange of information for technology environment & process & infrastructure development/implementation


# Platform for open source software/environments support


## collaborate with a variety technology enabling organizations such as POSSC/Linux Foundation/R Foundation

enable creation of regulatory compliant technology environments  


## Support for development of tools for new methodology


## could be longer term goal and requires structure/method to pursue through ISoP 501(3c) framework


# Guidance to adoption of new tools/environments/infrastructure - tech paper


# Finalize the previous ISoP Tools Survey and communicate results and call to actions from it?


## refresh the ISoP Tools Survey on set periodic basis to ensure consistent understanding of member interests and concerns and needs


## tools committee recognizes that nmusers has been the de facto platform for communicating not just nonmem but also methodology and technology related issues

what is your preferred method to communicate for these types that you would actually use?  
discuss  
discord  
twitter  
stack exchange  
email lists  
other  
[concern survivability - nmusers example]  
~ 10% scientific or nonmem questions - makes it hard to find info (is an email list currently relevant in 2022+)  


## <a id="org279870b"></a> Formalized/published/documenated comparison of Tools - punt to tool makers - request them to fill out capabilities sheet

we could potentially do a first draft  
what are the pros/cons?  
solicit manufacturers input to ensure completeness
